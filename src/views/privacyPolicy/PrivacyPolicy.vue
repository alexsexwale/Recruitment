              <p>The definitions used in the Website Terms and Conditions shall apply mutatis mutandis in this Privacy Policy.</p>
              <p>Jobox has created this privacy policy in order to demonstrate Our firm commitment to the right to privacy. The following discloses the processing practices pertaining to information on the Jobox Website.</p>
              <p>By using the Website and accepting the Terms and Conditions You also agree to this Privacy Policy. If You do not agree to this Privacy Policy, You may not use the Website. The terms "We," "Us," "Our," or "Jobox" includes Jobox (Pty) Ltd and Our affiliates.</p>
              <p>Jobox's Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information processed by Jobox. 'Personal information' means any personal details which you provide in any way through the use of this Website, in any form whatsoever, capable of identifying You which includes but is not limited to your names, postal and physical addresses, contact numbers, e-mail address, opinions, preferences, name of your University and any other type of personal information as defined in the Data Protection Laws, each of which forms a separate data tag of information on the Website.</p>
              <p>We will review this Privacy Policy regularly, and We may update the same on the Website, from time to time, at our sole discretion.</p>

              <p>We collect Personal Information about Our Users in order to provide Our Services, and customer support. Our Services and customer support are provided through many platforms including but not limited to: websites, phone apps, email, and telephone. The specific platform for Services and customer support You interact with may affect the Personal Information We process.</p>
              <p>Not all information requested, collected, and processed by Us constitutes "Personal Information", especially if the information is incapable of identifying a specific person, falls under the Data Protection Laws exceptions to processing or is for historic and statistical purposes “Non-Personal Information”. This will include the majority of "User Generated Content" that You provide Us with the intention of sharing with other Users. Such Non-Personal Information is not covered by this Privacy Policy. However, Non-Personal Information may be used in aggregate or be linked with existing Personal Information; when in this form it will be treated as Personal Information. As such, this Privacy Policy will list both types of information for the sake of transparency.</p>
              <p>In some situations, Users may provide Us with Personal Information without Us asking for it, or through means not intended for its purpose. Whilst We may take reasonable steps to protect this data, the User will have bypassed Our systems, processes, and controls and thus the Personal Information provided will not be governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>
              <p>In some situations, Users may provide Us with Personal Information over platforms that are outside of Our control; for example through Affiliates, social media platforms or forums. Whilst any Personal Information processed by Us is governed by this Privacy Policy, the platform or forum by which it was communicated will be governed by its own Privacy Policy.</p>

              <p>You have a number of other rights in relation to the Personal Information, however, there may be restrictions on how You may exercise these rights. This is largely due to the nature of the Services We provide. Certain Personal Information is processed in order to facilitate Fixed Terms Contracts and the Job between Users, facilitate the payments, and provide protection for the legitimate Users in Our marketplace and You have the right to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>seek human review of automated decision-making or profiling</li>

              <p><b>Human review of automated decision making/profiling</b> - In the case of Our selection algorithms, it is not possible to exercise this right as this selection is a fundamental part of the marketplace that Users participate in, opting out would mean not being able to participate in the marketplace.

              <p><b>Temporary restriction to processing</b> - under certain circumstances You may exercise this right, in particular, if You believe that the personal data We have is not accurate, or You believe that We do not have legitimate grounds for processing your information.
