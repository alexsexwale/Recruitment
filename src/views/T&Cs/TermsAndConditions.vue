              <p>Jobox is an online platform to facilitate interactions between the Student and the Client. We assist the Clients and Students to make informed decisions by providing a facility to rate and review Students but We cannot be held liable if the review and rating of a Student does not match the quality of what is done or a service that is performed as We do not control the ratings and reviews of the Students or the Clients.</p>
              <p>The Client determines the amount the Client intends to pay for the Job and We charge the Fee for certain Services, such as but not limited to introduction fees for Jobs, listing upgrades dependent on your elected memberships. When the Client uses a Service that has a Fee, the client has an opportunity to review and accept the Fee that will be charged by Us for the Service that We provide which We may change from time to time and We will update You in this regard by updating Our Website Terms and Conditions. We may choose to temporarily change the fees for Our Services for promotional events (for example, discounts on memberships) or new services, and such changes are effective when We post the temporary promotional event or new Service on the Website.</p>
              <p>Unless otherwise stated, all costs and Fees are quoted in South African Rands (ZAR).</p>
              <p>In return for providing a facility to source Services, Jobox charges a Fee for each Job. Upon registering for an Account, You agree to this Fee being levied and consent to the amount prior to confirming the Job.</p>
              <p>The Client is entitled to make payment of the amount prior to the commencement of the Job and hereby agrees to allow Jobox to hold the payment of a Job in Escrow. In the event that the Client does not make upfront payment, the Client shall make payment immediately on receipt of Jobox’s invoice.</p>
              <p>Jobox cannot be held liable if the Client does not make the payment for the services rendered by the Student in terms of the Job or if there is a delay in transferring the payment that is held in Escrow to the Student. Subject to the Client making payment for the Job, Jobox will release the payment to the Student in terms of the Fixed Term Contract within 7 (seven) days from completion of the Job.</p>
              <p>The Client hereby indemnifies Jobox against any and all claims that the Student may have against Jobox, however so arising as a direct, indirect or consequential result of the Client failing to timeously make payment for the Job.</p>
              <p>Fees for Our Services and product offerings are subject to change without notice.</p>

              <p>Upon the Client awarding a Job to a Student, and the Student’s acceptance of the Job on the Website, the Client and Student will be deemed to have entered into a Fixed Term Contract under which the Client agrees to purchase, and the Student agrees to render/deliver the Client Job. The User agrees not to enter into any contractual provisions in conflict with the Fixed Term Contract.</p>
              <p>You are solely responsible for ensuring that You comply with your obligations to other Users. If You do not, You may become liable to that User. You must ensure that You are aware of any domestic laws (including common law), international laws, statutes, ordinances and regulations relevant to You as a Client or Student, or in any other use You may make through the Website.</p>
              <p>If another User breaches any obligation to You, You are solely responsible for enforcing any rights that You may have. For the avoidance of doubt, We have no responsibility for enforcing any rights under a Fixed Term Contract. We merely provide a space where Students and Clients can find each other, and We facilitate the payment process. We are not liable for anything that may happen between the Users before the Job is awarded, whilst the Job is being performed and after the completion of the Job.</p>
              <p>Jobox cannot be held liable for the non-payment from the Client to the Student upon the completion of a Job or the pro-rata payment when a Job is cancelled.</p>
              <p>Jobox cannot be held liable for inadequate quality of work that is done by a Student.</p>
              <p>Jobox cannot be held liable in the case of an On-site Job, a Student or Client does not show up on time or at all to the premises or location that the Student promised the Client to be at.</p>
              <p>Whilst Jobox attempts to screen all Clients and Students prior to accepting the application, Jobox cannot be held liable for any fake Job postings.</p>
              <p>Notwithstanding the above, Jobox endeavours to create a list of Jobs that are offered on the Website together with recommended Users for the completion of the Job.</p>
              <p>Nothing in these Terms and Conditions is intended to override a right that by applicable law may not be excluded.</p>
              <p>Each User acknowledges and agrees that the relationship between Clients and Students is that of an independent contractor. Nothing in this Terms and Conditions creates a partnership, joint venture, agency or employment relationship between Users.</p>
              <p>Nothing in this Terms and Conditions document shall in any way be construed as forming a joint venture, partnership, franchise or an employer-employee relationship between Jobox and the User.</p>

              <b>Cancellation before the Student applies for the Job</b>
              <p>In the event that a Client removes a Job offering prior to any Student accepting and entering into a Fixed Term Contract, Jobox shall not charge the Client any Fee, except the banking transaction fee in the event that the Client made upfront payment of the Fee, held in Escrow and which Fee is to be reimbursed to the Client.</p>
              <b>Cancellation of Job whilst the Job is on-going </b>
              <p>Should the Client terminate the Job after acceptance and entering into a Fixed Term Contract, for any reason whatsoever, the following cancellation policy will be applicable:
